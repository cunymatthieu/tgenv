# Summary: Run an executable with the selected Terragrunt version
#
# Usage: tgenv exec <command> [arg1 arg2...]
#
# Runs an executable by first preparing PATH so that the selected Terragrunt
# version's `bin' directory is at the front.
#
# For example, if the currently selected Terragrunt version is 0.7.0:
#   tgenv exec plan
#
# is equivalent to:
#   PATH="$TGENV_ROOT/versions/0.7.0/bin:$PATH" terragrunt plan
